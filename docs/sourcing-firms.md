# Sourcing Firms

The below table is a list of companies that scrape the web for personal information and sell it to companies.
According to [GDRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) they must stop process your 
data if you ask them to. This file is to serve as a library for such firms as I find them and provide easy
links to opt out of processing.
